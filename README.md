## Motivation

Back in its days, those programmable RPN pocket calculators by HP were
state-of-the art technology. They were used by engineers to build bridges, tall
buildings, aircraft and even spacecraft.

But programming them was never easy since the platform was limiting; it was
basically a high-level assembler that you had to use.

So here are some examples showing how to get from modern high-level programming
languages to the HP-15C.

This piece of software is so cool it can even interact with SwissMicro's
replica which has a USB port: You can download and upload programs between your PC (or Mac) and the SwissMicro DM-15L.
